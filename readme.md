I made this small library for myself to assist me in debugging code. I'm a big fan of [prettyPrint](https://github.com/jamespadolsey/prettyPrint.js "prettyPrint on GitHub"), but one gripe of mine with that library is that it's often hard to "get" the structure of an object just from a glance.

This will basically just dump out your variable in json format structured in a html list, which can be styled with CSS. The list elements are collapsible so you can navigate through your object like you do when inspecting it in Firebug.

I have not done a lot of testing with this, nor am I planning on supporting this or developing it much further, so use it with care and use it as is.
